# NeighbourhoodMap

## Description

* This application integrates the google Maps API, the fourSquare API and Knockout.js to provide a list of interesting locations around Praça da República in Coimbra with the rating and the address of each place. It is responsive in both mobiles and desktops.

* The list of places can be filtered by typing text corresponding to the location you are interested in in the search bar.

* So far, only a few locations are avaliable. TODO: Use the places library in google Maps to add interesting places automatically instead of hard-coding locations.

## Instructions to run

* Fork/Clone this repo to your computer using gitBash or similar and run index.html. If you cannot or don't want to use gitBash, you can use the application [here](http://khaltar.github.io/NeighbourhoodMap).

## Licence

This application is avaliable under the MIT Licence and all suggestions and bugfix contributions are welcome. Just send up a pull request
